Launching a Python wrapper/app from a C++ executable involves creating a subprocess to run the Python script. You can use the popen function in C++ to achieve this. This function opens a process by creating a pipe, forking, and invoking the shell.

Here's a basic outline of how you might implement this:

Step 1: Create a Python Wrapper Script
Let's say you have a Python script named python_wrapper.py that interfaces with the Bard API. This script reads input from standard input (stdin), performs the API call, and writes the results to standard output (stdout).

Step 2: C++ Code to Launch the Python Script
In your C++ program, you can use popen to launch the Python script. Here's an example of how this could be implemented:


In this example, execPythonWrapper is a function that takes a command string (in this case, the
command to run the Python script) and executes it using popen. It reads the output of the Python script from the pipe and returns it as a string.
